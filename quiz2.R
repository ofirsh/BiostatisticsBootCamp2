# Question 1
# ----------
# 
# What is the delta method asymptotic standard error of sqrt(phat) where phat is X/n where 
# X∼Binomial(n,p)?


# Question 2
# ----------
# 
# 
# You are a bookie taking $1 bets on the NFL Ravens game. 
# The odds you give betters determines their payout. 
# If you give 4 to 1 odds against the Ravens winning, then if a person bets on the Ravens winning and they win, 
# you owe them their original dollar, plus an additional $4 (a total of $5). 
# If a person bets on the Ravens losing and they lose, then you owe them their original dollar back, 
#     plus $0.25 (a total of $1.25).
# 
# Suppose you collect a > 0 one dollar bets on the Ravens winning and b > 0 one dollar bets on the Ravens losing. 
# What should you set the odds so that, regardless of the outcome of the game, you neither win nor lose money? 
# Note, in this case, the betters place their bets and learn the odds later. 
# Note also, the odds are something that you set in this case, not a direct measure of probability or randomness.


# Question 3
# ----------
# 
# 

# In a randomly sampled survey of self-reported stress levels from two occupations, the following data were obtained
# High Stress     Low Stress
# Professor 	    70
# Lion Tamer 	15
# 
# What is the P-value for a Z score test of equality of the proportions of high stress?
# (Note the notation 1e-5, for example, is 1×10−5).
# 
# 4e-15
# 1e-14
# 1e-5
# 1e-3


# Question 4
# ----------
# 
# 
# Consider the following data recording case status relative to an environmental exposure
# Case 	Control
# Exposed 	45 	21
# Unexposed 	15 	52
# 
# What would be the estimated asymptotic standard error for the log relative risk for this data? 
# Consider case status as the outcome. That is, we're interested in evaluating the ratio of the proportion of 
# cases comparing exposed to unexposed groups.
# 
# Around 0.05
# Around 1.25
# Around 0.25
# Around 1.05


# Question 5
# ----------
# 
# If x1∼Binomial(n1,p1) and x2∼Binomial(n2,p2) and independent Beta(2,2) priors are placed on p1 and p2, 
# what is the posterior mean for p1−p2?



# Question 6
# ----------
# 
# Researchers conducted a blind taste test of Coke versus Pepsi. 
# Each of four people was asked which of two blinded drinks given in random order that they preferred. 
# The data was such that 3 of the 4 people chose Coke. 
# Assuming that this sample is representative, report a P-value for a test of the hypothesis that 
#     Coke is preferred to Pepsi using a **two sided** exact test.
# 
# Around 0.6
# Around 0.5
# Around 0.4
# Around 0.3
